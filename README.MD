## MOTIVATION
 In this project I wanted to create a command application that a user can use accepting their input. Ideal for a comapany looking to mange their empolyees database using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
## PROBLEMS
Well the problem i'm having i wish i could tell you for some I apparently have somethinf wrong with my schema and the datbase isn't coming up telling me that I dont have any tables i need and outsider to look and tell me what I'm doing wrong i guess. The update function was giving me the most trouble.
 
## What I Learned
 I'm not how to pout what I learned into words this project.There is link pages diving into ingquirer,propmt use of a switch statement matching the inquirer.propmt types to match the schema.sql
## Stand Out
 What makes this project stand out it displays the of requires, inquirer, db.query's. This project can be used by a a store to add departments,roles, and employees. This app can be used to update the list of employees someone may have in this table
